# RFX-mod2 as a flexible device for reversed-field-pinch and low-field tokamak research #paper

## Remarks
- This is a very difficult paper: it deals with many advanced topics, and assumes a lot of previous knowledge
- The MHD control system has been greatly improved (4x48 -> 8x72 pickup-coils, 2kHz -> 200kHz bandwith)
- There are cad models of rfx-mod2, find where they are.
## To understand #todo
- basics of [Plasma physics](../plasma_physics.md), and plasma in tokamaks
- a basic understanding of the original rfx experiment + rfx-mod 
	- [ ] find/ask where rfx stuff is and study it
		- [ ] get the rfx cad and render it
- tearing modes #plasma_physics
- Reverse Field Pinch 
- shaped plasmas 
- triangularity in plasma
- magnetic chaos #plasma_physics
- WTF is Transport #plasma_physics
- H-mode, L-mode #plasma_physics
- deep understanding of safety factor and other relevant plasma stuff
### Unfinished #todo
- This need to be re-read with a deeper understanding
- It appears that I need to understand better plasma physics #plasma_physics
