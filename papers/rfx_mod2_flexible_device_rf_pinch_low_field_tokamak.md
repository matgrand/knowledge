# RFX-mod2 as a flexible device for reversed-field-pinch and low-field tokamak research

## Remarks
- This is a very difficult paper: it deals with many advanced topics, and assumes a lot of previous knowledge
- The MHD control system has been greatly improved (4x48 -> 8x72 pickup-coils, 2kHz -> 200kHz bandwith)
- There are cad models of rfx-mod2, find where they are.
## What I need to understand before
- basics of [Plasma physics](../plasma_physics.md), and plasma in tokamaks
- a basic understanding of the original rfx experiment + rfx-mod 
- tearing modes
- Reverse Field Pinch
- shaped plasmas 
- triangularity in plasma
- magnetic chaos
- WTF is Transport
-
