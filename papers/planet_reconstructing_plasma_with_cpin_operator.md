# Reconstruction of plasma equilibrium and separatrix using convolutional physics-informed neural operator

![](imgs/planet_reconstructing_plasma_with_cpin_operator.png)


- This is about plasma equilibrium and separatrix reconstruction. The idea is to do what [FRIDA](../phd/FRIDA.md) does but faster, using 3 concatenated neural networks
- They called it PLANET
## Intro
- plasma equilibrium reconstruction is slow
- magnetic diagnostics are not enough to reconstruct the plasma, mostly in the core region, they are for the surface of the plasma
