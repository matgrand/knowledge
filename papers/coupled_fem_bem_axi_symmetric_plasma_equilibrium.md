This is a *very long* paper
#todo let's read it
## Introduction
- Equilibrium codes are useful for:
	- design of tokamaks
	- scenario performance prediction
	- **design of feedback control schemes** 
	- MHD stability analysis
- 

## To Understand
- [ ] difference between fixed-boundary and free-boundary in equilibrium reconstruction
