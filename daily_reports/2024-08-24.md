- analyzed synthetic equilibrium iter datasets https://github.com/matteobonotto/ITERlike_equilibrium_dataset
- fully understood the implementation part of [planet_reconstructing_plasma_with_cpin_operator](../papers/planet_reconstructing_plasma_with_cpin_operator.md)
- the physics part is still difficult
