### Stuff done
- Read Hippo paper, about origins of state space models, no report, also needs a re-read, heavy on mathematical stuff.
- Implemented 2 different architectures for Planet, still very easy, achieved good results using currents only.
- discussed with Umbe about Mamba architecture + state space models.
### Stuff to do:
- implement grad shafranov physics informed loss, as done in planet
- test including magnetic measurements
- test including non-magnetic measurements
- implement trunck and branch network
- implement diffusion model for the solution
- Use state space models for plasma related stuff ->
- #hard Implement State Space models for Planet (this requires framing the problem in time domain, generating a lot of samples, it's probably better to apply it first to something else, also requires rewriting frida)
