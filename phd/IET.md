# IET Inverse equilibrium tool

- [x] implement IET in python (maybe not needed) âœ… 2024-08-26
      update: Domenico already did it: https://github.com/DA2412/IETy

## How to use IET
There is a guide in the repo, runtime is not needed. It says to use r2020a, I used r2024a and it worked except for the equilibrium section where there is a version bug, it's an easy fix-> ```.cla -> cla()```
I will ask for a pull request, I also compiled the  ```.mex``` files for mac arm64.
For the installation, nothing is needed (I think, because I tried a lot of stuff before), just open the repo in matlab and run the 3 ```.mlapp``` apps. Check terminal for errors. 
1) ```IET_code/IET_SHAPING_TOOL/IET_SHAPING_TOOL_App.mlapp```
2) ```IET_code/IET_EQUILIBRIUM_TOOL/IET_EQUILIBRIUM_TOOL_App.mlapp```
3) ```IET_code/IET_OPTIMIZATION_TOOL/IET_OPTIMIZATION_TOOL_App.mlapp```
The tool is very sensitive to the order of the operations. So follow the guide carefully.

Note: to generate the mex files sometimes it is necessary to include llapack: ```mex whathever.cpp -llapack``` 

## IET code only
This is better imo, I compiled the mex arm also for this one.
