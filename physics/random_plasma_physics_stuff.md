### Measure temperature
- Thomson scattering (this works for very range of temperatures)
- Charge exchange, for ions temperature (neutrals do charge exchange with the ions, they make electron jump and decay with an energy correlated with temperature)
- Thermal Helium beam
- Electron Cyclotron Emission
- Soft X-Ray
